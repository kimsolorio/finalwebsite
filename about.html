                        <p class="paragraph">Things started soon after I concluded my 2 year religious mission for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. I spent my time knocking doors, teaching religion to people
                            who found interest in it. Eventually most of my time turned into training other fellow missionaries as a leader amongst them. I was able to get to know the people of Idaho
                            really well. I loved the service I was able to provide to the communities I served.<br>
                            After the two years in Idaho and Wyoming, I got my first job as a salesman working for T-mobile in Ogden, Utah. I broke into working retail and 
                            learned all the tricks of the trade when it came to selling. I loved having money, taking girls out on dates, living the single life. As most of you
                            know, the only thing that could get in the way of a 20-year-old is a female. I met my soon-to-be wife at church gathering. I got her number, we went on a few 
                            dates, and soon found out that she lived in Logan, Utah. This predicament is what actually lead me into my next job. <br>
                            I found that Verizon wireless was hiring. I was a top performing salesman for T-mobile, ranking in the top 3 of my store every month, and consistently at the top
                             50 in the compnay as a whole. Verizon offered me the job and so the next 3 years went by. <br>
                             <br>
                             I had now had 4 years of sales experience and as we introduced a new member to our small family, the demands changed and so I searched for a job as a banker 
                             for Wells Fargo. I spent three years here developing futher business and customer relations skills. I was a business banker, and a business advocate. I 
                             lead Wells Fargo in our outreach efforts for the district. I reached out to businesses and coordinated with them into giving financial seminars for their employees.
                             While at the bank, I changed Majors at Utah State University. I went from a Nurse major to a PR major. Realizing full-well that my experience in the last years had
                             developed into something that I truly enjoyed. <br>
                             <br>
                             I started my owh digital marketing agency, focusing on the latino market in Cache Valley. I found success in aquiring 4 clients within 2 months. I gained
                             knowledge and experience for the next 6 months of marketing, advertising and content develpment. I had a blast and was able to leave my job at Wells Fargo and dedicate 
                             myself full-time to my business. <br>
                             I was surfin the internet one day, when I stumbeled upon a Fox Pest Control job posting. I applied out of curiousity, and to make a long story short: I got the job. <br>
                             In the first 2 months I traveled more around the US than I have my whole life. I'm the Social Media Manager, handeling all of their accounts and in charge of leading the 
                             social media ads for the company. <br>
                             My develpoment into who I am today has been layed out by every single job I've had. I love what I do and cannot wait to see what future skills I will be developing.
